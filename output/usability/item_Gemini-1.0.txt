======= /item-verbose "Perceived Ease of Use" 5 =======
## Perceived Ease of Use: Survey Item Generation with Explanations

## Construct Definition:

Perceived Ease of Use (PEOU) refers to the degree to which a person believes that using a particular system would be free from effort. It is a key construct in the Technology Acceptance Model (TAM), which posits that PEOU positively influences a user's intention to use a technology.

## Property Type:

PEOU is a **belief**, meaning it reflects an individual's subjective perception of a system's ease of use.

## Applicable Entity:

PEOU is typically measured in relation to a specific **technology or system**.

## Characteristics:

* **Subjective:** PEOU is based on individual perceptions and experiences.
* **Context-dependent:** PEOU can vary depending on the specific technology, user characteristics, and situational factors.
* **Multidimensional:** PEOU can be influenced by various factors, such as the system's complexity, learnability, and consistency.

## Dimensionality:

PEOU is generally considered a **unidimensional** construct, although some researchers argue for a multidimensional structure with sub-dimensions like learnability and complexity.

## Context:

PEOU is relevant in various contexts, including human-computer interaction, software development, and marketing.

## Related Constructs:

* **Perceived Usefulness:** The degree to which a person believes that using a particular system would enhance their performance or productivity.
* **Attitude towards using the technology:** A person's overall evaluation of a technology, encompassing both PEOU and perceived usefulness.
* **Behavioral intention to use:** The likelihood that a person will use a particular technology.

## Survey Items:

Here are 5 survey items for measuring PEOU, along with explanations for each item:

1. **"Using this system would be easy for me."** (Explanation: This item directly assesses the individual's perception of the system's ease of use.)
2. **"I would find it easy to learn how to use this system."** (Explanation: This item focuses on the learnability aspect of PEOU.)

5. **"I would find it easy to become skillful at using this system."** (Explanation: This item focuses on the ease of acquiring skills for using the system effectively.)

## Conclusion:

These survey items provide a starting point for measuring PEOU. The specific items chosen and the wording used should be tailored to the specific technology or system being evaluated and the target population.
