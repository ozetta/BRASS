## Perceived Ease of Use

**Definition:** Perceived ease of use (PEOU) refers to the degree to which a user believes that using a particular system would be free from effort. It is a subjective assessment based on the user's perception rather than an objective measure of actual difficulty.

**Property Type:**  Subjective, psychological 

**Applicable Entity:** Individuals, users

**Characteristics:**

* **Subjectivity:** PEOU is based on individual perceptions and can vary greatly between users.
* **Context-dependent:** The perceived ease of use can change depending on the specific task, environment, and user experience.
* **Dynamic:** PEOU can evolve over time as users become more familiar with the system.

**Dimensionality:** Typically considered **unidimensional**, representing a single continuum from "very difficult to use" to "very easy to use." However, some researchers argue for a **multidimensional** view, suggesting that different aspects of ease of use (e.g., learnability, understandability) might be perceived independently.

**Context:**  Widely used in technology acceptance models (e.g., TAM, UTAUT) to predict user acceptance and adoption of new technologies.

**Related Constructs:**

* **Perceived Usefulness:**  The degree to which a user believes that using a system would enhance their performance.
* **Usability:** The extent to which a system can be used by specified users to achieve specified goals with effectiveness, efficiency, and satisfaction in a specified context of use.
* **User Experience (UX):**  A user's overall experience interacting with a system, encompassing aspects like ease of use, usefulness, and enjoyment.
* **System Complexity:** The objective difficulty of understanding and using a system, often inversely related to perceived ease of use.
